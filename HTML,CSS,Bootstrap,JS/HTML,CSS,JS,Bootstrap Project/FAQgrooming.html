                <h1 style="color:#6d0c1e;">FAQ about grooming</h1>
                <ul class="general_ques">
                    <li><h3>Does dog grooming reduce shedding?</h3>
                    <p>Shedding is a natural occurrence in dogs. The frequency and amount of hair they shed depend on their breed, health, and coat type. Regularly brushing your dog can reduce shedding. It stimulates the natural oils on his hair and skin and also eliminates loose dander. If you bring your dog to a dog groomer, his shedding will be reduced through the help of special grooming tools and grooming products. The dog groomer may use a de-shedding shampoo and conditioner on your pooch when washing him. Depending on your dog’s coat, they may also rake it gently to get rid of any loose or dead hair.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Should I get my dog groomed whilst she's in heat?</h3>
                        <p>It is not advisable to bring your pooch to a groomer when she is in heat. Keep in mind that there are other dogs inside the grooming establishment. There is a high chance that your pooch might attract male dogs. This can be a very risky situation especially if she isn't spayed. It is best to visit the groomer once her heat subsides</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>How Long Does Dog Grooming Take?</h3>
                    <p>Time taken to groom a dog depends on the condition of the dog’s coat, size of the dog, and groomer’s services. For a normal bath and blow-dry, it may take 60 to 90 minutes. For haircuts, show clips, dematting and health cuts like trimming nails, ear and eye cleaning, it may take 2 to 3 hours.</p></li>

                    <li><h3>Why Dog Nail Trimming Is Sometimes Best Left to Professionals?</h3>
                        <p>Obviously, trimming dog nails doesn’t have to be done by professionals. Many pet parents are well-equipped and skillful at keeping nails the correct length. But just as many people are either uncomfortable with it or simply want groomers to handle it.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Why grooming is important?</h3>
