        <P style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Brushing your dog ventilates their coat, helping it grow healthy and strong and takes away old and damaged hair. Grooming also ensures that your dog's skin can breathe and keeps down the level of grease in their coat. Too much grease can block pores and cause irritation and all sorts of skin problems.
           

            When most people think about pet grooming, they conjure up images of bows, brushes, and running after their pets. Others have the misconception that pet grooming is not necessary. However, it is an important aspect of a pet’s overall well-being and health. Pet grooming is important for the whole family as well. You do not want your dirty and smelly pet jumping on your couch or clean bedsheets.
                    
            With proper pet grooming, you will get rid of shedding, fleas, ticks, and various health conditions. Proper grooming is more than just having a cute pet. By grooming your pet, you will also be tackling potentially unhealthy conditions. It will also allow you to identify any underlying conditions or diseases early. Therefore, you will be able to take your furry friend for treatment sooner and more efficiently.
                    
            However, many pet owners find that their pets do not enjoy the grooming process. If you are in the same situation, you should consider sending your pet to professional groomers. As an animal member of your family, your pet certainly deserves the best grooming. If you have a young pet, make the grooming process an important part of his or her learning. This will benefit you and your pet as he or she reaches maturity.<br><br>

      <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Miss Magnolia Script', cursive, sans-serif; color: black;"> 1. Dog Training Benefits Both Dog and Owner
        When it comes to training, your dog isn’t the only one reaping the rewards. Working regularly with your dog helps you to better understand their needs, making you an even better owner as well.
        
        It can also be a great source of exercise and open up new possibilities for you—the better behaved your dog is, the easier it is to take them along wherever you go.<br><br>
        
        2. It Makes Them Safer
        The better you can control your dog with voice commands, the better you can protect them when unrestrained. A dog that bolts when off the leash is much more likely to run in front of a car, or to slip out the front door before you’re ready to leave.
        
        Also, should your dog ever become lost or need to be placed in a shelter, being well-trained only increases the likelihood they will behave well, or, in the event it’s necessary, be placed with a new family.<br><br>
        
        3. It Helps Your Dog to Be More Sociable
        As your dog learns to respect boundaries and behave properly in social situations, other dogs (and people) will be more comfortable and at ease around them as well. As a result, more of these interactions will be positive experiences for your dog.
        
        If they begin to enjoy these social encounters, your dog will be more relaxed and manageable with each interaction.</p>

              What is good dog nutrition?
              Good nutrition is feeding your dog the building blocks and energy components that allow them to grow, develop to their potential and stay active throughout their life.There are many ways to feed your dog and hundreds of diets to choose from.  Most people tend to use dry and canned dog food for convenience and cost. However, for owners who are open minded about their dog’s diet, there are alternatives to dry and canned dog food that may offer better nutrition for your particular dog.
               
              At Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital, we have spent decades educating pet owners about proper dog nutrition for dogs of all ages, breeds, conditions and lifestyles. Because canine nutrition ultimately plays a large part in the quality of your dog’s life, we want to share some veterinary insight with you about proper dog nutrition, whether you are looking for puppy food recommendations, or adult and senior dog nutrition advice. 
               
               
              The keys to canine nutrition
              The following dietary components represent the fundamental keys to canine nutrition:
              Proteins: Proteins are complex molecules made up of amino acids, the building blocks of cell growth, maintenance and repair. In companion animals like dogs, one of the biggest demands for protein comes from the maintenance of fur and hair, which can use up to 30 percent of a dog’s daily protein intake
              Fats: Fats provide the most concentrated source of energy in the canine diet. They also supply the fatty acids that are important building blocks for important substances and essential to maintaining normal, healthy cells
              Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates can be broken down by the digestive system and converted to glucose which can also be a source of energy. Carbohydrates in the form of whole grains can furnish iron, minerals and fiber, as well as other beneficial nutrients
              Vitamins: Vitamins organic substances, or synthetic derivatives thereof, required for normal body functioning. They are also important in the conversion of calories to energy, the boosting of immunity and other body processes
              Minerals: Minerals are inorganic nutrients that make up less than 1% of a dog’s body weight but are essential to many important functions, such as growth, strong bones and healthy teeth</p><br><br?<br>
